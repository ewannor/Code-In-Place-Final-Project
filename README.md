# Code-In-Place-2021-Final-Project
Image Visualization Program.
This program is the final project I submitted to 
Code In Place Spring 2021 - a free intro-to-coding course by some 
Computer Science lecturers of Stanford University.
It visualises data using image data stripes/bars.
The program is based on an assignment by Nick Partlante, a lecturer at Stanford University, USA
